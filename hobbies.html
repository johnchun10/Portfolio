        <h3 align = center>I try my best to enjoy life so I push myself to try new things everyday. Here are a few of my everyday hobbies that I've adopted over the years.</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>ROWING</h4>
        <p>I've recently started rowing due to me constantly injuring myself during soccer. Rowing involves much more 
            linear movement which is perfect for my body. I enjoy rowing because it is a great source of 
            exercise and it involves much precision in your form and stroke.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>READING</h4>
        <p>Ever since I was little, I've enjoyed reading. Reading would take me to many different worlds where my imagination would be able to run wild. I still read today, albeit less than before. I picture reading as almost a form of meditation for me.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>GAMING</h4>
        <p>Out of all of my hobbies, I would say this is my guilty pleasure. I believe I spoil myself too much in gaming because it is so immersive for me. A lot of my friends spend their time online playing games along with me. While I do believe gaming in general is not unhealty for you, I do believe in self-limitation which is why I need to learn this technique as quickly as possible!</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>CELLO</h4>
        <p>I used to play the piano along with the cello but I moved full time over to cello. I do have to say the cello is harder than some other instruments but I believe it is worth it to learn it beacuse of the outcome of the beautiful music you can make.</p>
